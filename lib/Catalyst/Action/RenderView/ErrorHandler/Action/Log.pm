=head1 DESCRIPTION

Really a rather useless example of an ErrorHandler action. It uses catalysts
logging facilities to log errors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # In a configuration somewhere:
    error_handler:
        actions:
            - type: Log
              id: log-error
              level: error
        handlers:
            fallback:
                actions:
                    - log-error
